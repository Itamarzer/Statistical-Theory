##  Project Summary

This study explores the **relationship and potential causality** between **heart disease** and **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**. Our central hypothesis is that **heart disease may lead to the development of CKD**, but not necessarily the reverse.

### Key Contributions:
- **Population-based analysis** of the two diseases
- **Statistical testing and hypothesis validation**
- **Regression modeling** (linear, nonlinear, and logistic)
- **Machine learning classification and forecasting**
- **Merging datasets** to extract common patterns

### Datasets Used:
- `heart_disease_uci.csv`
- `Chronic_Kidney_Disease.csv`  
(Original source: UCI Machine Learning Repository)

- **Google Colab** (Recommended for quick testing)
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- **VSCode or PyCharm**
- **Command-line Python (3.8+)**
